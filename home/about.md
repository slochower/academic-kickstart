# Biography

I’m David Slochower, a postdoc with Mike Gilson at UCSD.

I’m working on nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of protein dynamics, computational methods for assessing small molecule binding free energies, and force field development with the [Open Force Field Initiative](http://openforcefield.org/). I also work on simulations of physiological membranes, focusing on the physical chemistry of phosphoinositides.
